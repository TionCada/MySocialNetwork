# My Social Network

## About the project

This is an educational project based on "React JS - way of samurai 1.0" course, which is free and can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb7gMluAeao&list=PLcvhF2Wqh7DNVy1OCUpG3i5lyxyBWhGZ8. This project is an analogue of modern social networks, such as Facebook, but with pretty basic functionality, which though can be developped in the future. Website is hosted at https://logo-social-network.web.app, so feel free to check it out.

Current project version includes implementation of:

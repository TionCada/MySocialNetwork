## About the project

This is an educational project based on "React JS - way of samurai 1.0" course, which is free and can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb7gMluAeao&list=PLcvhF2Wqh7DNVy1OCUpG3i5lyxyBWhGZ8. This project is an analogue of modern social networks, such as Facebook, but with pretty basic functionality, which though can be developped in the future. 

Current project version includes implementation of:
